- client request a server, there event queue comes into play. each request keeps on queuing in event queue. and those request is executed one by one in FIFO order in event loop.

- request can be blocking operations(synchronous) and non blocking(asyncsynchronous)

- by synchronous we mean that code will be executed line by line 

- by asynchronous we mean that time consuming code will be executed in background and remaining code will be executed before hand

- blocking operation need a thread/worker to perform task.(thread pool is pool of thread which is responsible to perform blocking tasks). threads are limited and by default we have 4 threads. If we are developing high scale product it is good practice to go for non-blocking operations
